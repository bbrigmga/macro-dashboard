## Indicators Tracked

1. **Average Weekly Hours**
    - Hours worked in the private sector
    - Warning signals for consecutive months of decline
    - Part of the danger combination when declining

2. **Core CPI (Consumer Price Index Less Food and Energy)**
    - Inflation excluding volatile food and energy prices
    - Month-over-month change tracking
    - Warning signals for accelerating inflation

3. **Initial Jobless Claims**
    - Weekly unemployment claims data
    - Warning signals for consecutive increases
    - Part of the danger combination when rising

4. **PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures)**
    - The Fed's preferred inflation measure
    - Year-over-year change tracking
    - Combined analysis with other indicators

5. **Manufacturing PMI Proxy**
    - Proxy for ISM Manufacturing PMI using FRED data
    - Expansion/contraction threshold at 50
    - Part of the danger combination when below 50

6. **USD Liquidity**
    - Federal Reserve balance sheet minus reverse repo and Treasury General Account
    - Weekly data tracking liquidity conditions
    - Key indicator of monetary policy stance

7. **Non-Defense Durable Goods Orders**
    - New orders for manufacturing capital goods
    - Month-over-month percentage changes
    - Leading indicator of business investment

8. **2-10 Year Treasury Yield Spread**
    - Difference between 10-year and 2-year Treasury yields
    - Inverted spread signals potential recession risk
    - Key yield curve indicator

9. **Copper/Gold Ratio vs 10Y Treasury Yield**
    - Ratio of copper to gold commodity prices
    - Compared against 10-year Treasury yield
    - Bullish sentiment indicator when ratio rises

### Manufacturing PMI Proxy Calculation

The Manufacturing PMI Proxy is a sophisticated calculation using five key FRED economic series:

1. **Data Series Used**:
   - `AMTMNO`: New Orders
   - `IPMAN`: Production
   - `MANEMP`: Employment
   - `AMDMUS`: Supplier Deliveries
   - `MNFCTRIMSA`: Inventories

2. **Calculation Methodology**:
   - Calculate month-over-month percentage changes for each component
   - Transform to a diffusion index using the formula: 
     ```
     Diffusion Index = 50 + (pct_change / rolling_std_dev * 10)
     ```
   - Cap the index between 0 and 100

3. **Component Weights**:
   - New Orders: 30%
   - Production: 25%
   - Employment: 20%
   - Supplier Deliveries: 15%
   - Inventories: 10%

4. **Interpretation**:
   - Index above 50 indicates economic expansion
   - Index below 50 indicates economic contraction
   - Provides a proxy for the ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI)

## Key Concepts

### Danger Combination
The dashboard tracks a specific combination of warning signals that indicate potential market trouble:
- Manufacturing PMI below 50
- Initial Claims rising for 3+ weeks
- Average Weekly Hours dropping for 3+ months

### Risk Framework
The dashboard uses a comprehensive framework for risk assessment based on PCE and Initial Claims:
- **Risk On**: PCE Bullish + Initial Claims Bullish/Neutral (favorable economic conditions)
- **Risk Off**: PCE Bearish + Initial Claims Bearish (stressful economic conditions)
- **Risk Neutral**: Mixed signals requiring caution

Additional context from USD Liquidity, yield curve positioning, and commodity ratios helps refine risk assessment.

## Maintenance

The dashboard automatically updates with new data as it becomes available from FRED and Yahoo Finance:
- Initial Jobless Claims: Updated weekly (Thursday)
- PCE: Updated monthly
- Core CPI: Updated monthly
- Average Weekly Hours: Updated monthly
- Manufacturing PMI Proxy: Updated monthly (calculated from multiple FRED indicators)
- USD Liquidity: Updated weekly (calculated from Fed balance sheet data)
- Non-Defense Durable Goods Orders: Updated monthly
- 2-10 Year Treasury Yield Spread: Updated daily
- Copper/Gold Ratio: Updated daily (from Yahoo Finance commodity data)
