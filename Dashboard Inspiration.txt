"Post 1: Quick explainer: 
Initial Jobless Claims = how many people filed for unemployment for the first time that week. 
Released every Thursday. 
Higher numbers = more people losing jobs. 
Lower numbers = strong job market.

Post 2: His exact playbook for rising claims:
Scale back aggressive positions
Shift toward defensive sectors
Build cash reserves 
"Small moves early beat big moves late."

Post 3: Number 4: PCE 
"Everyone watches CPI, but PCE guides policy." 
His framework: 
PCE dropping + Stable jobs = Add risk 
PCE rising + Rising claims = Get defensive

Post 4: What is PCE exactly?
The Fed's preferred inflation measure

Tracks ALL spending: 
consumer, business, government

Includes healthcare costs insurance covers
Shows how people adapt to price changes 
Released monthly by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

Post 5: The PM's words stuck with me: 
PCE isn't just a number. 
It's a window into:
Rate trends
Market conditions
Risk appetite

Post 6: Number 5: ISM Manufacturing 
"Think of it as the economy's pulse" 
Above 50 = Growth 
Below 50 = Contraction

But he taught me: Watch trends, not levels.

Post 7: What is ISM Manufacturing?
It's basically a monthly survey of manufacturing businesses
And it shows if factories are growing/shrinking.

Post 8: The danger combination to watch:
ISM below 50
Claims rising 3 weeks straight
Hours worked dropping

"When these align, protect capital first."

Post 9: His defensive playbook:
Review tech holdings
Shift to quality stocks
Keep dry powder ready
Wait for signals to clear

Then return to growth when trends improve.

Post 10: His core principles: 
Never trade on one signal alone. 

Wait for confirmation. 

Make gradual moves. 

Stay disciplined. 

It's not about being right - it's about being profitable.

Post 11: What stuck with me most: 
Markets look complex. 
But they're driven by simple forces: 

Jobs. Spending. Business activity. 

Master these signals, and you'll see what others miss.

He compared it to weather forecasting: 
You can't predict every storm. 
But you can spot conditions that make storms likely.
That's what these 5 numbers do."
